### Definitions
- **value-neutral**: whether something is "good" or "bad" is determined entirely by the purposes for which it is used; for example, a knife can be used to chop vegetables (good) or stab someone (bad)
- **technological somnambulism**: we "willingly sleepwalk" through the process of reconstituting the conditions of human existence; generally new technological is adopted with very little ethical reflection on it
- **ethics of new technology**: about which tech to promote and which tech to discourage, and how to develop and disseminate tech in just and ethical ways
- **the innovation presumption**: we should invent, adopt, and use new technologies *whenever* we can
	- **liberty**: people are permitted to do what they like so long as they do not harm others
	- **technological optimism**: technology generally improves human life
	- **technological determinism**: (usually implicit) belief that technological innovation is the basic cause of changes in society and is inevitable (**a cause of technological somnambulism**)

### Review Questions
1. Explain some of the ways technologies are not always just value-neutral tools
2. What are some examples of technologies that shape our "form of life"? How do they shape our form of life rather than being mere tools?
3. What does Winner mean by "technological somnambulism" and why does it happen? How do we wake up?
4. What is the innovation presumption and why do we tend to make it? Why or how should we question it?
5. When evaluating a new technology, what four questions should we ask but often don't?
